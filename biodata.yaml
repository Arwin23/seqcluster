# ## Genome data -- Next generation sequencing and Galaxy

# Details about the genomes you want to include.
#  Required genome fields (corresponding to Galaxy's tool_data_table_conf.xml columns):
#    dbkey   - globally unique identifier for the genome (e.g., hg19)
#    name    - descriptive name for the given genome (to be displayed in Galaxy, e.g., Hsapiens)
#  Optional genome fields (corresponding to Galaxy's tool_data_table_conf.xml columns):
#    formats, species, dbkey1, dbkey2, value, path, index
#  Additional genome fields specific to data deployment:
#    genome_indexes - list of tool indexes specific to the associated genome (overrides global 'genome_indexes')
genomes:
  - dbkey: hg19
    name: Human (hg19)
    annotations: [srnaseq]

# Global set of indexes to include for each genome.
# Available choices are in GENOMES_INDEXES_SUPPORTED in cloudbio/biodata/genomes.py
genome_indexes:
  - bowtie2
  - star
