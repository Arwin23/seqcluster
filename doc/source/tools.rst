`TFmiR`_: disease-specific miRNA/transcription factor co-regulatory networks v1.2. It uses results from UP/DOWN regulated miRNA/Genes and allows to focus in only one disease to create different type of relationships between miRNA/TF/Gene. Easy to use. Probably need to filter the output sometime due to the big networks that can result from an analysis. 

`Diana-TarBase v7.0`_: Database for validated miRNA targets. Many filter options. Good for small candidate miRNAs set studies.

`StarScan`_: Database to browse the targets of miRNAs from degradome data. It has a fancy interface, and many species and data from GEO.
