IsomiRs
-----------

`miR-142-3p isomiR <http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/early/2015/07/02/rna.048876.114>`_:  "We furthermore demonstrate that miRNA 5â€²-end variation 
leads to differential targeting and can thus broaden the target range of miRNAs." 

Techonolgy
-----------

`miRQC <http://www.nature.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/nmeth/journal/v11/n8/full/nmeth.3014.html>`_: work studying the accuracy and specificity of different technologies to detect miRNAs.

`Important features affecting the detection of small RNA biomarkers <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4487992/>`_: How the sample can affect the detection of biomarkers (like RIN value, concentration, ...)

`Comparison of alignment and normalization <http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/17/bib.bbv019.full>`_ . I will take the message that TMM and DESeq/2 normalization are the best to avoid strong bias if we consider to have a small proportion of DE miRNAs. For the alignments, here you have another comparison for miRNAs annotation: https://rawgit.com/lpantano/tools-mixer/master/mirna/mirannotation/stats.html
