Report
========

Beside the static HTML report that you can get using ``report`` `subcommand <http://seqcluster.readthedocs.org/getting_started.html#report>`_, you can download `this <https://github.com/lpantano/seqclusterViz/archive/master.zip>`_ HTML. (watch the repository to get notifications of new releases.)

* Go inside ``seqclusterViz`` folder
* Open ``reader.html``
* Upload the ``seqcluster.db`` file generated by ``report`` subcommand.
* Start browsing your data!

An example of the HTML code:
